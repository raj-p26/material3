# Contributing to material3

Thank you for sharing your interest in this project. I would like to have new and creative ideas all the time. Before everything, please make sure you have reviewed the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.

# Proposing Changes

The best way to propose a change is to directly create a Pull Request on this repository.

First, write a short problem statement, which clearly and briefly describes the problem you want to solve independently from any specific solution. It doesn't need to be long or formal, but it's difficult to consider a solution in absence of a clear understanding of the problem.

Next, write a short solution proposal. How can the problem (or set of problems) you have stated above be addressed? What are the pros and cons of your approach? Again, keep it brief and informal.

# Bug reports

A bug is either a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository, or indicates missing, unclear, or misleading documentation. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.

2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the main branch in the repository.

3. Isolate and report the problem — ideally create a reduced test case.
